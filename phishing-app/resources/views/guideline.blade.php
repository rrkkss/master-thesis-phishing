        When logging in to University Information System, your browser may ask about saving your password. We do not recommend saving your password in browser, especially if you are logging in from a computer shared by several users. Your password may be discriminated this way.
    </span></div><br>
<div class="small">
    <span class="small">
        After login each user can change their password to the system; requirements for safe password are stored in the relevant application.

        To increase the level of protection of any personal data, the security protocol SSL has been selected for communication with the system. SSL is a world-renowned standard for communication on the Internet. Even prominent Czech banks have been using this standard for the service called "homebanking". The SSL protocol operates on the principle of exchanging electronically signed certificates, mutually verified, between the server and your computer; therefore, no data can be inserted in this encoded data-flow. To make the work with certificates easier, the so-called "certification authorities" have been put in operation to facilitate a transparent and almost invisible check of this encoded channel. Thanks to this user-friendly and simplified procedure it only takes to set your browser so that it trusts your certificate authority which is ÄŒZU v Praze CA.
